## Testing
User feedback helps netexec get better. All issues and comments can be directed to the [issues page on GitHub](https://github.com/dogoncouch/netexec/issues), or emailed to [dpersonsdev@gmail.com](mailto:dpersonsdev@gmail.com). Please ensure you are using the latest release.

Issues based on bugs should be well documented, with any error message and an explanation of how the issue can be reproduced. Additional information such as Python version and operating system are also useful.

## Coding
If you have a bug fix, or an idea for a feature, we would love to hear about it! You can start an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/dogoncouch/netexec/issues), email the author at [dpersonsdev@gmail.com](mailto:dpersonsdev@gmail.com), or create a [pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/dogoncouch/netexec/pulls).

Code should run with Python 3; and Python 2 support is not required. Coding style should be as simple and readable as possible. Variable names should tell you exactly what a variable does. Use four spaces for indentation (no tabs), and avoid one-liners; equivalent blocks of code are usually easier to read.

## Usage
For usage instructions, see [README.md](../README.md).
